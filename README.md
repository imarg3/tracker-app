- React Native Framework
- React Hooks
- React Context
- Axios
- React-Native Async Storage (An asynchronous, unencrypted, persistent, key-value storage API)

## React Hooks :

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useIsFocused: The useIsFocused hook will cause our component to re-render when we focus and unfocus a screen. Using this hook component may introduce unnecessary component re-renders as a screen comes in and out of focus. This could cause issues depending on the type of action we're calling on focusing. Hence we recommend to use this hook only if you need to trigger a re-render. For side-effects such as subscribing to events or fetching data, use the methods described above.
- custom hooks : useLocation & useSaveTrack
